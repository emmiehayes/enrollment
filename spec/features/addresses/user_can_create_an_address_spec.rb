As a user
When I visit `/students/:id/addresses/new`
And I fill in description with a description (e.g. "Summer Address")
And I fill in street with a street address
And I fill in city with a city
And I fill in state with a state
And I fill in zip code with a zip code
And I click submit
I am taken to that student's show page
And I see the description, street, city, state, and zip on that page
